# Shitlist
Are you tired of getting in groups with players you have had a bad experience with before and want a reminder of it.
Or do you and your friends or guild keep a list of good/bad players and keep the names write down on a piece of paper or in text file?

Then this is the addon for you, **#Shitlist** will let you set a note on a player from a list of pre set messages and a optional text.
The player note will then be displayed on the player information tooltip.
